A NetLogo Model to simulate escape from a maze

## WHAT IS IT?

A NetLog script written for version 6.1.1. A model of agents trying to find maze exit according to their features. In this case I will study thier memory and ability in recording path followed. 

## HOW IT WORKS

## HOW TO USE IT

Press Setup to start

## THINGS TO TRY

Change the spacing to generate longer path in the maze.
